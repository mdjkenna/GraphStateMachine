/**
 * Configuration for the dispatcher channel used by traversers and walkers.
 *
 * This class allows customizing the behavior of the internal channel used for action dispatching,
 * which affects how actions are buffered and processed.
 *
 * The properties of the class are used to create a regular coroutines channel.
 * For more information onf their significance see resources on `Channel` in the Kotlin coroutines library.
 *
 * @param A The type of action arguments that can be passed when dispatching actions.
 * @property capacity Controls the buffering behavior of the channel:
 *   - [Channel.UNLIMITED]: The channel has unlimited capacity (bounded only by available memory)
 *   - [Channel.CONFLATED]: Only the most recently sent action is kept, overwriting previous ones
 *   - [Channel.RENDEZVOUS]: No buffering (capacity = 0). Each send suspends until received.
 *   - [Channel.BUFFERED]: Default. Uses a reasonable default capacity (currently 64).
 *   - Positive number: Creates a channel with the exact specified buffer size.
 * @property onBufferOverflow Determines the behavior when the buffer is full:
 *   - [BufferOverflow.SUSPEND]: Default. Suspends the sender until space becomes available.
 *   - [BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST]: Drops the oldest action in the buffer to make room.
 *   - [BufferOverflow.DROP_LATEST]: Drops the action being sent if the buffer is full.
 * @property onUndeliveredElement Callback invoked for actions that couldn't be delivered
 *   (e.g., when the channel is closed while actions are still buffered).
 *   Default is an empty handler.
