/**
 * Primary interface for interacting with a graph-based walker. This interface combines the capabilities
 * of both [WalkerDispatcher] and [WalkerState], providing a unified API for both
 * dispatching actions to and reading state from the walker.
 *
 * The walker represents states as vertices in a directed graph, with edges representing
 * possible transitions between states. The walker can be walked by dispatching actions,
 * which cause transitions along the edges of the graph according to the defined transition rules.
 * Unlike a traverser, a walker only supports forward movement and does not maintain a history
 * of visited states.
 *
 * This interface is typically obtained by using the builder function in [mdk.gsm.builder]:
 * - [mdk.gsm.builder.buildWalker]
 *
 * @param V The type of vertices (states) in the graph. Must implement [IVertex].
 * @param I The type of vertex identifiers used in the graph.
 * @param F The type of transition guard state, which controls conditional edge transitions. Must implement [mdk.gsm.state.ITransitionGuardState].
 * @param A The type of action arguments that can be passed when dispatching actions.
 *
 * @see WalkerDispatcher For dispatching actions to the walker
 * @see WalkerState For reading the current state
 * @see mdk.gsm.builder.buildWalker
