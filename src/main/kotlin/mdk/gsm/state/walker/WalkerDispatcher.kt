/**
 * Interface for dispatching actions to a graph-based walker, causing state transitions.
 *
 * This interface provides methods to dispatch forward-only actions to the walker,
 * which trigger transitions between states (vertices) according to the defined graph structure and
 * traversal rules. Unlike [mdk.gsm.state.traverser.TraverserDispatcher], this interface only supports forward movement
 * (Next and NextArgs actions) and reset.
 *
 * The dispatcher is responsible for:
 * - Ensuring actions are processed in the order they are received
 * - Managing the state transitions triggered by actions
 * - Providing mechanisms to await action completion
 * - Handling the lifecycle of the walker's processing resources
 *
 * @param V The type of vertices (states) in the graph. Must implement [IVertex].
 * @param I The type of vertex identifiers used in the graph.
 * @param F The type of traversal guard state, which controls conditional edge traversal. Must implement [mdk.gsm.state.ITransitionGuardState].
 * @param A The type of action arguments that can be passed when dispatching actions.
 *
 * @see mdk.gsm.state.GraphStateMachineAction
 * @see Walker
 * @see WalkerState
