/**
 * Represents the current state of a graph transition in the graph state machine.
 * 
 * This class encapsulates the current position within the graph transition, including the current vertex,
 * boundary status, and any arguments passed with the action that caused this state to be published.
 * 
 * The transition state can be used to determine whether the transition has reached a boundary condition
 * (such as the beginning or end of a directed acyclic graph), which is particularly useful for
 * workflow-like applications where there is a definite start and end.
 *
 * @param V The vertex type, which must implement [IVertex] with identifier type [I]
 * @param I The type of the vertex identifier
 * @param A The type of arguments that can be passed during transition actions
 * 
 * @property vertex The current vertex in the transition
 * @property transitionBounds Indicates whether the transition has reached a boundary condition
 * @property args Optional arguments associated with the current transition state, typically provided during a [GraphStateMachineAction.NextArgs] action
 * 
 * @see TransitionBounds
 * @see GsmController
 * @see GraphStateMachineAction
