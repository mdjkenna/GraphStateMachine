/**
 * Interface for dispatching actions to a graph-based traverser, causing state transitions.
 *
 * This interface provides methods to dispatch various [mdk.gsm.state.GraphStateMachineAction]s to the traverser,
 * which trigger transitions between states (vertices) according to the defined graph structure and
 * traversal rules. Actions can be dispatched either asynchronously or synchronously with result awaiting.
 *
 * The dispatcher is responsible for:
 * - Ensuring actions are processed in the order they are received
 * - Managing the state transitions triggered by actions
 * - Providing mechanisms to await action completion
 * - Handling the lifecycle of the traverser's processing resources
 *
 * @param V The type of vertices (states) in the graph. Must implement [IVertex].
 * @param I The type of vertex identifiers used in the graph.
 * @param F The type of traversal guard state, which controls conditional edge traversal. Must implement [mdk.gsm.state.ITransitionGuardState].
 * @param A The type of action arguments that can be passed when dispatching actions.
 *
