/**
 * Interface for reading the current state and traversal history of a graph-based traverser.
 *
 * This interface provides read-only access to the traverser's current state and path history,
 * allowing clients to observe the traverser without exposing a way of modifying it which is conducive to unidirectional data flow architectures.
 *
 * @param V The type of vertices (states) in the graph. Must implement [IVertex].
 * @param I The type of vertex identifiers used in the graph.
 * @param F The type of traversal guard state, which controls conditional edge traversal. Must implement [mdk.gsm.state.ITransitionGuardState].
 * @param A The type of action arguments that can be passed when dispatching actions.
