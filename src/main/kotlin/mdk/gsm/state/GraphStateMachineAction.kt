 * Represents actions that can be dispatched to a graph state machine.

 *
 * @param A The type of arguments that can be passed with certain actions (specifically [NextArgs]).
 *          This allows for passing contextual data during state transitions.
 *
 * @see TransitionState For the resulting state after an action is processed
